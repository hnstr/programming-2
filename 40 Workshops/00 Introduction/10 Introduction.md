Welcome to the Python workshops!

The structure of a workshop differs somewhat from the C problem sets. First and foremost, there are no lectures. There is however a substantial amount of reading to be done. You will find that the first workshop covers concepts most of which you already know from C. The second and third workshop will cover a new subject: Object Orientated Programming (OOP).

The Python workshops consist of up to three parts which you must submit in order to complete the workshop:

## Exercises (Workshop 1 and 2)

Exercises mainly consist of practice problems introducing you to Python and preparing you for the programs section. You are required to submit each exercise in the specified file. The exercises will be checked, but not graded.

## Questions (Workshop 1 and 2)

The questions are there to test your knowledge of the readings you have done. We require that you answer these questions on the website, and we will check your answers, but similarly to exercises your answers will not be graded.

## Programs (Workshop 1, 2 and 3)

Programs are the real deal. This where you put your newly gained Python knowledge to the test. Programs are generally a bit bigger than exercises and questions, and in contrary to exercises and questions, programs will be graded. So make sure you spend some time on improving your style and design!

Hacker editions have been replaced by hacker additions. If you have time to spare after finishing, cleaning, and perfecting your code, you can continue with the hacker additions.

Now off you go into the [wondrous world of Python](http://xkcd.com/353/).
