# Course components

You're on your own through this course most of the time, though we will be,
quite literally, on your side when you're in the labs. Make good use of the
various materials that are in the course. Here's a guided tour through the
important parts.

## Lectures

Harvard's video lectures discuss all theory that is needed to pass the quizzes.
Students are encouraged to watch the lectures at home or on the way to the lab,
in order to be able to spend lab time programming and asking questions.

## Sections

Lectures are supplemented by videos of sections led by the Havard teaching
fellows. Different sections are offered for those less comfortable, those more comfortable, and those somewhere in between.

## Walkthroughs

Integrated into problem sets are "walkthroughs," videos via which the course's staff offer direction on where to begin and how to approach a challenge. Students are expected to watch walkthroughs to prepare for asking questions at the lab.

## Problem Sets and Workshops

The six problem sets and workshops are the hard work of the course, on which
you will spend most of the lab time and then some more.

All weekly deadlines are at 15:00h on Fridays. Late work is not ordinarily
accepted, except in case of medical emergency. Technical difficulties are not
considered emergencies.

In order to accommodate students with different backgrounds, some problem sets
are released in two editions: a standard edition intended for most students and
a "Hacker Edition" intended for some students. Both editions essentially cover
the same material. But the Hacker Edition typically presents that material from
a more technical angle and poses more sophisticated questions. Hacker Editions
are graded separately from standard editions, but those students who submit the
former do not receive any form of extra credit outright. When determining
grades at term's end, however, we do bear in mind submissions of Hacker
Editions.

To be clear, we encourage most students (including aspiring computer scientists) to tackle the standard editions. However, you may choose, week to week, which edition to submit. You may not submit both or some amalgam of the two.

Problem sets and the final project will be evaluated along the following axes:

* Scope

	Have you tried doing everything?

	1. incomplete, even though some parts may be present
	2. whole parts are missing
	3. a small part of the requirements is not implemented
	4. everything is there
	5. above and beyond (please confer with your TA)

* Correctness

	Does your program do what is expected by a user?

	1. takes too much time to get it working
	2. some problems when testing, buggy
	3. it works without real bugs, but not always the correct result
	4. correct results in all common cases of input
	5. even with erroneous input the program still works

* Design

	How orderly is your code?

	1. lots of complex code, or avoiding newly learned keywords
	2. too complicated, but you seem to know your stuff
	3. straightforward code, could be put a bit inefficiently
	4. makes good use of the possibilities in the language
	5. you've read up on design and applied it to your code

* Style

	How readable is your code?

	1. once or twice you did it right, but you should study the style guide
	2. you've read the style guide but haven't applied it consistently
	3. your code is readable and consistent, barring some minor problems
	4. the code is consistent, and only well-reasoned deviations from the guide
	5. you've clearly made your own choices but maintained perfect consistency

## Quiz

The course has one 75-minute quiz. It is "closed-book," but you may utilize during each quiz one two-sided page (A4) of notes, typed or written, and a pen or pencil, nothing else.

Unless arranged with the course's heads in advance, quizzes cannot ordinarily be taken at alternative times even if missed by accident, except in cases of medical emergency.
