Welcome to the Python workshops!

The structure of a workshop differs somewhat from the C problem sets. First and foremost, there are no lectures. There is however a substantial amount of reading to be done. You will find the first two workshops cover concepts most of which you already know from C. Therefore we suggest you skim through the readings and tackle the exercises and questions. If you experience difficulties completing the exercises and questions simply take another look at the readings. Be warned though, the third workshop covers a new subject: object oriented programming (OOP in short) and as such you will most likely spend more time reading. 

Each Python workshops consists of three parts which you must submit in order to complete the workshop:

## Exercises
Exercises mainly consist of practice problems introducing you to Python and preparing you for the programs section. You are required to submit each exercise in the specified file. The exercises will be checked, but not graded.

## Questions
The questions are there to test your knowledge of the readings you have done. We require that you answer these questions on the website, and we will check your answers, but similarly to exercises your answers will not be graded.

## Programs
Programs are the real deal. This where you put your newly gained Python knowledge to the test. Programs are generally a bit bigger than exercises and questions, and in contrary to exercises and questions, programs will be graded. So make sure you spend some time on improving your style and design!

Now off you go into the [wondrous world of Python](http://xkcd.com/353/).
