If you want to see how your speller compares with your fellow students and assistants, you can go to our <a href="http://www.ragey.net/board/">score board</a> and upload your speller there.

Note that you should upload only your **compiled speller** inside a zip directory. No need to send in your source code! Use **zip map speller** to create a zip and then send in the resulting **map.zip**.

Please note that you shoud **also upload your speller on the submit tab on this site**. That submission should contain your source code and Makefile.
