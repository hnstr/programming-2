Welcome to the Python workshops!

The structure of a workshop differs somewhat from the C problem sets. First and foremost, there are no lectures. There is however a substantial amount of reading to be done. You will find that the first workshop covers concepts most of which you already know from C. The second and third workshop will cover a new subject: Object Orientated Programming (OOP).

Hacker editions have been replaced by hacker additions. If you have time to spare after finishing, cleaning, and perfecting your code, you can continue with the hacker additions.

Now off you go into the [wondrous world of Python](http://xkcd.com/353/).
