## Python versions

You will have noticed that the video contained examples written in Python 3. However, the remaining parts of these materials are in Python 2. Due to the availability of some important libraries, many teams in the world still write their Python as version 2. No worries, the differences are not huge, and you'll be able to pick up Python 3 at any time without any trouble.
