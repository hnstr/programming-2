# Welcome to workshop 2!

This week you'll learn about:

* debugging;
* functions and methods;
* returning values;
* `random`;
* plotting;
* lists, lists and lists;
* dictionaries; and
* tuples.

Please prepare using the readings below. They will not always 
immediately make sense without practice, but that's no problem. You may want 
to re-read them during your practice session!
